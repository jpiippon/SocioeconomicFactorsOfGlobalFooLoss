grain is 2.2-3.3% and 1-1.5%, respectively.


The loss rate at post-harvest handling, storage, processing, and distribution stages of meats can be approximated as 1.4-2.1%, 2.5- 3.7%, 1.1%, and 3%, respectively.

Geographically, northern China tends to show a higher postharvest storage loss than southern China.
According to a survey by State Administration of Grain (SAG and NDRC 2011), the average
household grain storage loss in northeastern provinces, northwestern provinces, the middle and lower reaches of Yangze River, and the Yellow-Huaihe-Haihe Plain is 10.2%, 8.8%, 7.4%, and 5%,

Mould damage is regarded by local farmers as more of an inconvenience than a loss , since all the grain will be used for food or for brewing after washing to remove visible',","A loss assessment survey was conducted in the major cereal and pulse crop producing
areas of Arrillara, Oromiya and Southern Regions. Cereal production was adversely
affected by an unusual rainfall pattern this season. Shortage of rain during the
growing period resulted in some crop failure or reduced yields, and heavy
unseasonable rai11 at crop matw-ity led to problems at harvest &J.d fw-ther crop losses.
This had implications for the loss assessment exercise. In selecting sample areas,
consideration had to be given to identifying those that were less severely affected and
where grain was expected to be stored for several months, as well as trying to ensure
reasonable coverage ofthe crops under study.
Group and individual farmer interviews were conducted at the start, to identify postharvest constraints and to assess their importance in relation to the constraints in the
total agricultural system. Insect infestation in storage was identified as an important
problem. A common coping strategy is for farmers to sell grain early in order to
avoid high losses and then to buy grain later as required. Pressure to fmd cash (to pay
taxes and loans) as well as the fear of insect infestation during storage were the main
reasons given by farmers for selling grain soon after harvest. Early sales at low prices
removes an opportunity for farmers to add value to their production by selling at
higher prices later in the season or for increasing household food security through
retention of more grain on the farm.
Farmers' stores were sampled on two occasions, first within the first month of storage
and again later in the season. Questionnaires were used to collect information on the
history of the grain, details of storage methods and patterns of removal and grain use.
Samples were analysed to determine loss caused by insects and mould damage using a
'count and weigh' technique, but also taking account of farmers' practices in dealing
with damaged grain. The loss recorded in samples was related to the pattern of grain
use to derive a cumulative figure of loss over the season.","Survey","Boxall, Robin (1998)","http://gala.gre.ac.uk/10758/","Weight losses during storage are variable and have been estimated to be 3.3 % for maize , 2.1 % for wheat and 2.4 % for t ' eff .

of 11% for overall losses in grai.tJ. crops is derived (table S 1 ). Viewed in the context
of an annual average grain production of 9.5 million tonnes, this is equivalent to just
over 1 million tonnes. The figure corresponds closely with Loerbroks' earlier
estimate. Loerbroks gave no guidance on where best to intervene to reduce losses.
The figures obtained here show that on-farm storage losses may account for over half
the post-harvest losses. Currently, emphasis is being given on improving food
security through increased crop production using improved seed and fertiliser. The
new high-yielding varieties of grains being promoted are more susceptible to pest
attack after harvest and storage losses can be expected to increase further. Postharvest improvement programmes that target peasant farmer storage can therefore be
expected to achieve a significant impact in reducing losses, increasing farm incomes
and improving household food security."

The field study was performed at four farms (two farms for winter wheat, one
farm for spring wheat and one farm for field peas), with 1–3 plots per farm. Farms
near Helsinki and Vihti were selected for practical reasons. On all farms the study took
place on the same day as the harvest, except for one farm where the field had been
harvested some days before. Samples were placed into plastic bags for weighing.
Wheat samples were sorted with a 2 mm sieve, and field peas were sorted by hand in
order to remove inventory obsolescence. To confirm the results, the weighing was
done with a calibrated scale. Samples were converted into a dry matter due to

The questionnaire was sent to 964 pea producers, of which only 114 producers
responded to the questionnaire and 65 completed the questionnaire successfully. A large
proportion of the responses – 49 responses – were rejected because the producer reported
that it did not produce for human consumption (16), reported nothing for the use of peas (23), reported 0 kg yield (3 cases), and/or did not report yield at all (15 cases). Therefore,
when only complete answers are counted the final response rate was low – only 7%. 28
produced field peas and 37 produced green peas. Two field pea producers and one green
pea producer were organic producers, and the rest were conventional producers.","Survey","FoodLossPrimaryProd.pdf",,

Survey
The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest
losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng
District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured
questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception
about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice
farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti
region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest
losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other
important information collected included the causes of postharvest
losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.
Field experiment
Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by
farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4
x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications
per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land
clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and
transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,
dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that
were involved at each stage.
Experimental design
A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica
2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining
harvesting losses. The experimental design for milling yield was 2 x
3 CRD comprising 2 varieties and 3 milling machines.","Controlled Experiment","Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K. A2; article1379942599_Appiah et al.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285594317_Postharvest_losses_in_Africa_-_Analytical_review_and_synthesis_the_case_of_Ghana",

Table 6. The results showed that SB30 had marginally
higher milling yield (67.32%) than SB10 (66%).
However, the differences between the milling yields of
either the SB30 machine and the locally manufactured
milling machine or that of the SB10 machine and the
locally manufactured milling machine were significant.
The locally manufactured milling machine had the lowest
milling yield (63.33%). This implies that the locally
manufactured milling machine was less efficient as it also
resulted in higher percentage (52.7%) of broken grains
(Table 6). This implies that the local machine produced
less white rice per unit weight of paddy. This resulted in
less recoverable rice and therefore less revenue. SB30 is therefore superior to both SB10 and the Local machine in
terms of milling yield. In spite of the higher milling yield of
SB30, it is still lower than the 67.5% (2010 data)
considered to the lowest on record in the USA (Robinson,
2010). According to the author, this could lead to a shift
to selling more broken grains, consequently mean lower
prices. Norman and Otoo (2003) recommended that
improved dehulling and whitening machines should be
developed and tested for use in rice processing","Table 7. Effect of milling machine type on grain breakages.

The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the
Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between
2009 and 2010.
Survey
The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest
losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng
District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured
questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception
about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice
farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti
region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest
losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other
important information collected included the causes of postharvest
losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.
Field experiment
Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by
farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4
x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications
per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land
clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and
transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,
dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that
were involved at each stage.
Experimental design
A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica
2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining
harvesting losses. The experimental design for milling yield was 2 x
3 CRD comprising 2 varieties and 3 milling machines.","Controlled Experiment","Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K. A2; article1379942599_Appiah et al.pdf","http://academicjournals.org/article/article1379942599_Appiah%20et%20al.pdf",

The results of the survey showed that harvesting losses
ranged between 3.03 and 12.05% while threshing losses
varied from 0.53 to 4.07% (Table 3). Total losses due to
only harvesting and threshing losses at farmer’s fields
ranged between 5.60 and 16.14%. The differences in
postharvest losses among the farmers were due to
different level of skill of harvesting and threshing as well
as poor weed control. During the study it was observed
that the farmers’ fields were engulfed in a lot of weeds.
Poor weed control is known to interfere with effectiveness
of harvesting (Al-Khatib, 1995).","5","Case Study","Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K. A2; article1379942599_Appiah et al.pdf","http://academicjournals.org/article/article1379942599_Appiah%20et%20al.pdf",

reports a loss (between 7 and 22 percent of the sample in Malawi and Uganda, with one in 5 to one
in 7 maize farmers reporting a loss in Tanzania, depending on the survey year). Both the relatively
low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,
highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using
nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates
based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection
leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,
humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to
use less effective storage technologies.

cereals harvested in developing countries are lost annually (Chaudhry, 1982). Most of the Pakistani
scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our
country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to
the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.
Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing
Techniques”
21 International Journal of Research in Agriculture and Forestry V2 ● I6 ● June 2015
Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop
(Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional
methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1
or 0.28%,
0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting
losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,
AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,
2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with
conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They
recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain
losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.
Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,
transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,
respectively

Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain
losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only
minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi
(2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed
moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors
affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat
harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different
models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of
study were 31.4 kg ha-1
accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported
4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found
2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual
harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing
activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They
observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to
about 40.85 per cent.

Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop
(Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional
methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1
or 0.28%,
0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting
losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,
AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,
2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with
conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They
recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain
losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.
Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,
transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,
respectively

Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain
losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only
minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi
(2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed
moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors
affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat
harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different
models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of
study were 31.4 kg ha-1
accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported
4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found
2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual
harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing
activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They
observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to
about 40.85 per cent.

affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat
harvesting stage.",,"Literature Review","Shamabadi (2012)",,"According to a most conservative estimate, about 10% of the
cereals harvested in developing countries are lost annually (Chaudhry, 1982). Most of the Pakistani
scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our
country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to
the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.
Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing
Techniques”

Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop
(Iqbalet al., 1980). 

Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional
methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1
or 0.28%, 0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, 

Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting losses. 

Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,
AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,
2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. 

Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with
conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They
recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. 

Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain
losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.
Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,
transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,
respectively

Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain
losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only
minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period.
 Shamabadi
(2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed
moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors
affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat
harvesting stage. 

Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different
models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of
study were 31.4 kg ha-1
accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported
4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found
2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual
harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing
activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They
observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to
about 40.85 per cent.

consumption are grown. The cultivation of field peas is associated with a degree of risk,
since the yield varies considerably from year to year. Therefore, the proportion of land
used for pea production at farm level is normally quite low. 

There is no statistical data (cultivated area, number of holdings, yield) exclusively
on field peas for human consumption in the Swedish Board of Agriculture’s database.
Instead, the data presented for field peas includes peas for human consumption as well
as for feed. According to the commercial buyers, the total area used for cultivation of
field peas each year is approximately 1,250 hectares.
One of the two commercial buyers contracts around 40 farmers in the
Kalmar/Öland region and delivers the peas to the food industry. The total area used for
the cultivation of field peas in this area is approximately 350 hectares. We have no data
for the yield. The total losses in the buyer’s processing chain were 8% in 2013.
Approximately 20–30% of the losses were suitable for human consumption. Crop that
is downgraded by the buyer is used as animal feed.
The other buyer currently contracts around 50–60 farmers in Östergötland County.
The number has increased in the last few years. The peas are sold under the brand “Go
green” in smaller (grocery stores) and larger (canteens/catering facilities) volumes. The
buyer also exports about 400 tonnes/year to a company that produces canned field pea
soup. The total area used for the cultivation of field peas in Östergötland is around 800–
1,000 hectares. The average yield is 3 tonnes/hectare and the total yield is 8,500–9,500
tonnes per year

A questionnaire was sent to 41 farmers and the two commercial buyers of field peas for
human consumption in Sweden. The commercial buyers were also contacted during the
analysis of the results.","Survey","FoodLossPrimaryProd.pdf",,"The peas are sown between March and June in order to be harvested at different

crop damage during harvesting or handling and in-field damage from insects or other

the reason to be “Normal losses at threshing”","There are a total of around 90–100 farms where field peas for human

percent of total production in Malawi and Uganda respectively (Table 1), though only a minority
reports a loss (between 7 and 22 percent of the sample in Malawi and Uganda, with one in 5 to one
in 7 maize farmers reporting a loss in Tanzania, depending on the survey year). Both the relatively
low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,
highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using
nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates
based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection
leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,
humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to
use less effective storage technologies.

food losses during pre- and post-harvest handling operations,
including during manual processing that cause mechanical
breakage and spillage of the food, and irksomeness to the processor.
Crop losses occur during pre-harvest drying on the field were
caused by wild animals, birds and rodents. In worst cases, up to 32%
of maize-on-cobs could be lost to birds, monkeys, other rodents
before harvest, and through qualitative spoilage by mould and
fungi which could be extensive in wet conditions. Similar qualitative loss through aflatoxin contamination of maize and cassava in
Tanzania and Congo had been reported (Manjula et al., 2009). In
terms of proportion of matured crops, 15% was estimated as preharvest field loss for most grain and legume crops. The farmers
expressed their inability and skills to effectively prevent or control
field losses by pests and rodents. An estimated 1.5% of the maize,
millet, sorghum and groundnut outputs were estimated to be lost
during harvesting. Losses during transportation of the crops by
head-loads, on bicycles and other means were 2.5%. This compares
with 2.25% losses recorded during transportation of rice from the
field to the store and 1% from the store to the market for maize in
Madagascar (Hodges, 2012). An estimated loss of 13.4% for maize
(P ¼ 0.009), 20% for millet and sunflower, 18% for groundnut, 10% for
pigeon pea, 6% for sorghum and 5% for sesame occur when manual
methods of processing were used (Table 4). The losses were in form
of mechanical damage such as breakage, puncture, compression,
rupture, dent bruises, or spillages of the crops.","4

low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,
highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using
nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates
based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection
leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,
humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to
use less effective storage technologies.

percent of total production in Malawi and Uganda respectively (Table 1), though only a minority
reports a loss (between 7 and 22 percent of the sample in Malawi and Uganda, with one in 5 to one
in 7 maize farmers reporting a loss in Tanzania, depending on the survey year). Both the relatively
low incidence of PHL as well as the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL,
highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions14 as well as the importance of using
nationally-representative samples in quantifying PHL to avoid sample selection bias. PHL estimates
based on non-random samples are likely biased upwards if non-randomness in the sample selection
leads to overrepresentation of areas or groups with higher likelihood of incurring PHL, such as hot,
humid areas, which experience higher pest infestations, or poorer households, which are likely to
use less effective storage technologies.
